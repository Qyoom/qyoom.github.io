Hi, my name is Richard Walker. I'm a Scala and Javascript programmer, a former (and rebooting) graphic designer, a one time ESL teacher, an incurable journaler.

My list of heros include Amy Goodman, Leonardo Fibonacci, Benoit Mandelbrot, Marcel Duchamp, Saul Steinberg, Gertrude Stein, Rube Goldberg, Krazy Kat, Ai Weiwei, the brothers Quay, to name a random few...

### Thinking in Models

**Thinking is Models** is an exploration of learning in code, dynamic visualization, writing, and social media. Its inspiration draws from Scott E.

*Any number of functional relationships could arise in a model or in the world. A relationship could be linear, curved, S-shaped, or even have a threshold...Knowing the functional relationship between variables aids in all six reasons for modeling: to get the logic right, to explain data, to predict, to design, to act, and to explore possibilities.*

â€”Scott E. Page, *The Model Thinker* (p.103)
