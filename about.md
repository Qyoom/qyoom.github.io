Hi, my name is Richard Walker. I'm a Scala, Python, and Javascript programmer, a former graphic designer, a one time ESL teacher, an incurable journaler.

### Thinking in Models

**Thinking in Models** is an exploration of learning in code, dynamic visualization, writing, and social media. Its inspiration draws from Scott E. Page's course *Model Thinking* on Coursera, Enrico Coen's book, *Cells to Civilizations, The Principles of Change That Shape Life*, and my growing interest in agent based models where group behavior emerges from the actions of individuals in complex systems.

*Any number of functional relationships could arise in a model or in the world. A relationship could be linear, curved, S-shaped, or even have a threshold...Knowing the functional relationship between variables aids in all six reasons for modeling: to get the logic right, to explain data, to predict, to design, to act, and to explore possibilities.*

â€”Scott E. Page, *The Model Thinker* (p.103)
