In [Part 2 of this series](http://qyoom.github.io/coen-population-drift-2/) I attempted an alternative visualization of population drift, interpreted from Chapter 1 of Enrico Coen's Cells to Civilization. I say "attempted" because, although the implementation does a passable job simulating individual agents acting in a population, I was unable to coordinate close tracking of each agent from one cycle to the next. D3js is the renouned Javascript

To finish the treatment of Coen's four principles of evolution I will include biased sampling in the algorithm and let the visualization show its effect. From there, Coen takes us into genes and ecosystems.
