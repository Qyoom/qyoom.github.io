# Thinking in Models

**Thinking is Models** is an exploration of learning in code, dynamic visualization, 
  writing, and social media. Its inspiration draws from Scott E. Page's course
  *Model Thinking* on Coursera, Enrico Coen's book, *Cells to Civilizations*, and my
  growing interest in agent based models where group behavior emerges in complex systems.
